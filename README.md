# Face Expression Classification
This project uses deep learning to classify facial expressions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built in TensorFlow/Keras processes the facial images, training to recognize expressions using a dataset from Kaggle.

# Project Overview
The goal is to develop a facial expression classification system for applications like Human-Computer Interaction and psychological state assessment. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to monitor performance.
# Dataset
The model is trained on the Face Expression Recognition Dataset, which contains labeled facial images categorized by expression. The data is divided into training and validation sets, with image augmentation techniques applied to improve model generalization.
# Model Architecture
# The CNN model architecture includes:

Feature Extraction Layers: Convolutional layers with pooling to capture essential facial features.
Classification Layers: Dense layers with a final softmax layer for multi-class classification of expressions.
Data Augmentation: Applied using transformations like rescaling, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping to enhance training diversity.
# Training and Evaluation
The model trains for 40 epochs, with training and validation performance tracked over time. Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics help evaluate performance and identify areas for improvement.
# Visualizations
Performance metrics are visualized through training history plots, confusion matrix, and sample predictions to understand model accuracy and misclassification patterns.
# Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 52% on the validation set, with insights gained from the confusion matrix and classification report to guide further tuning.
